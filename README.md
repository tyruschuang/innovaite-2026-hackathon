## Details

- **What problem does this project solve?**  
  { Explain the pain point + who it helps + why it matters. }

- **Did you use any interesting libraries or services?**  
  CommonStack / Google Gemini – Vision-capable LLM for evidence extraction (OCR + categorization, damage detection)
  OpenFEMA API – Disaster declarations and county eligibility (no API key)
  Tesseract (pytesseract) + PyMuPDF – OCR on images and PDFs for amounts/dates before LLM
  FastAPI + Pydantic – Async API, structured schemas, validation
  ReportLab – PDF generation for cover sheets, damage summaries, and letters
  Jinja2 – Letter templates (landlord forbearance, utility waiver, lender extension)
  Next.js 16 + Radix UI + Framer Motion – Form flow, drag-and-drop evidence upload, download of the generated ZIP

- **What extension type(s) did you build?**  
  Web app – Next.js frontend
  FastAPI backend
  REST API for eligibility, runway calculation, evidence extraction, packet build, and action plan generation

- **If given longer, what would be the next improvement you would make?**  
  API performance – Parallelize OCR for evidence extraction and letter rendering; add shared HTTP client and eligibility caching
  Evidence pipeline – Stream processing so users see partial results while more files are processed
  More data sources – Historical SBA disaster loan data for expectation bands and context
  UI/UX polish – Progress indicators during packet generation and clearer loading states for long-running steps

## Set Up Instructions

You need both the backend and frontend running. The frontend calls the backend API at http://127.0.0.1:8000 by default.

### Prereqs
  Node.js 18+ (for the frontend)
  Python 3.11+
  Tesseract OCR installed on your system (e.g. brew install tesseract on macOS)
  CommonStack API key (free tier available at commonstack.ai) — or a Google AI (Gemini) API key if you prefer using Gemini directly

### Install
```bash
git clone {your-repo-url}
cd {your-repo-folder}
{install-command}
