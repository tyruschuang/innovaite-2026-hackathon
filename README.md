#  Remedy 
innovaite-2026-hackathon.vercel.app
The disaster relief product for small business; building a suitable action plan for recovery

---

## Details

- **What problem does this project solve?**  
  Remedy addresses disaster relief concerns by cutting time-to-submittable from days to about 30 minutes. It helps owners quickly create a submission-ready packet (cover sheet, damage summary, expense ledger, letters, evidence) and a 30-minute action plan, so they can immediately request rent forbearance, utility waivers, and lender extensions while applying for SBA/FEMA relief. The goal is to buy 2–4 weeks of runway and reduce friction during the worst period of the liquidity crunch.


- **Did you use any interesting libraries or services?**  
  - CommonStack / Google Gemini – Vision-capable LLM for evidence extraction (OCR + categorization, damage detection)
  - OpenFEMA API – Disaster declarations and county eligibility (no API key)
  - Tesseract (pytesseract) + PyMuPDF – OCR on images and PDFs for amounts/dates before LLM
  - FastAPI + Pydantic – Async API, structured schemas, validation
  - ReportLab – PDF generation for cover sheets, damage summaries, and letters
  - Jinja2 – Letter templates (landlord forbearance, utility waiver, lender extension)
  - Next.js 16 + Radix UI + Framer Motion – Form flow, drag-and-drop evidence upload, download of the generated ZIP

- **What extension type(s) did you build?**  
  - Web app – Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend
  - REST API for eligibility, runway calculation, evidence extraction, packet build, and action plan generation

- **If given longer, what would be the next improvement you would make?**  
  - API performance – Parallelize OCR for evidence extraction and letter rendering; add shared HTTP client and eligibility caching
  - Evidence pipeline – Stream processing so users see partial results while more files are processed
  - Better context - See 
  - UI/UX polish – Progress indicators during packet generation and clearer loading states for long-running steps
