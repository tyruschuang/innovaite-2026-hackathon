RE: Request for Payment Terms Extension — FEMA Disaster Declaration {{ disaster_id }}

Dear {{ lender_name }},

I am writing to request a temporary extension of payment terms on our account with your organization. Our business, {{ business_name }}, has been directly impacted by {{ declaration_title }}, officially declared a federal disaster under FEMA Declaration {{ disaster_id }}.

Due to this disaster, our business has been closed for {{ days_closed }} days, significantly impacting our cash flow and ability to meet current payment obligations on schedule.

{{ hardship_paragraph }}

I am requesting an extension of {{ days_requested }} days on all outstanding and upcoming invoices. This will allow us time to:

- Resume business operations
- Process insurance claims
- Access federal disaster relief programs (SBA disaster loans, FEMA assistance)

I am committed to maintaining our business relationship and meeting our financial obligations. I have attached documentation of the disaster impact and our current financial situation for your review.

Please contact me at {{ phone }} or {{ email }} to discuss a modified payment arrangement that works for both parties.

Thank you for your consideration and support during this challenging time.

Sincerely,

{{ owner_name }}
{{ business_name }}
{{ business_address }}
