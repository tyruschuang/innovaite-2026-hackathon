RE: Request for Late-Fee Waiver and Payment Extension — FEMA Disaster Declaration {{ disaster_id }}

Dear Customer Service,

I am writing to request a waiver of any late fees and a temporary extension on utility payments for my account at {{ business_address }}.

Our business, {{ business_name }}, has been directly impacted by {{ declaration_title }}, officially declared a federal disaster under FEMA Declaration {{ disaster_id }}. We have been unable to operate normally for {{ days_closed }} days due to this disaster.

{{ hardship_paragraph }}

Many utility companies offer disaster relief programs for affected customers. I am requesting:

1. Waiver of any late payment fees incurred since the disaster
2. A {{ days_requested }}-day extension on current and upcoming payments
3. Information about any disaster-specific assistance programs you may offer

I am actively pursuing federal disaster relief to restore our business operations and will resume normal payment as soon as possible.

Please contact me at {{ phone }} or {{ email }} to discuss available options.

Thank you for your understanding during this difficult time.

Sincerely,

{{ owner_name }}
{{ business_name }}
Account at: {{ business_address }}
